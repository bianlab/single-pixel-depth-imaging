## Network structure
    An end-to-end deep neural network structure is designed, which is shown as follows. For depth reconstruction, it contains the self-encoding network and parallel residual network respectively used for reconstruction of two-dimensional scene and depth information. Specifically, the self-encoding network (CONV1) firstly uses the fully-connected layer to convert the one-dimensional measurement to a two-dimensional image, and then uses a three-dimensional convolution kernel to perform multiple convolution operations to extract deep features. 
    The depth information reconstruction of the three-dimensional image is performed by connecting the parallel residual network (CONV2), and finally a grayscale image representing the height is obtained. The grayscale image is visualized in three dimensions to obtain the three-dimensional information of the object.
  
## Test 
To understand the complete process of SPDI network, run demo.py. <br>
    $ python3 demo.py 
This Demo gives the reconstruction of mountain peak, and background intensity is 1. <br>
